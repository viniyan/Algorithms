#ItÂ´s important to follow some sistematic steps while solving a problem. 
  #1- identify input and output data formats
  #2- passing them as parameters to a basic function
  #3- come up with some input and output examples
  #4- to facilitate testing, all tests will be represented by a dictionary with 'input' and 'output' keys, with the respectives examples as values
  #5- test if  the function is able to handle any set of valid inputs
  
  
#Problem 1: Alice has some cards with numbers written on them. She arranges the card in decreasing order
